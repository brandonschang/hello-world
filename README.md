# hello-world
My first GitHub repository. 
My name is Brandon Chang and I recently graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering. I am joining GitHub to continue my journey of building a foundation of computer programming in order to further personal interests and increase career opportunities in the near future.
